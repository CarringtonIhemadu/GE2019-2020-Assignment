### Description 

I have chosen to create a simple procedural generation game using unity, where the user will be able to navigate a map that randomly generates objects as the user navigates through the map. this idea was taken from games such as *The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth* or the *The Binding of Isaac*

the user will spawn on the map and then use the direction keys to move through the procedually generated layout 

the different objects that will be spawned on the map will affect the user differently. some may increase the players health and some may depleat the players health.
